Educational execution environment for GameBoy Classic (DMG 01) assembly (modified Zilog's 80 instruction set).
It will provide basic emulator functionality and additional 'debug mode' which could be used for assembly teaching purposes (execution flow graphs which could indicate stalls and run-time memory editing)

Current goal is to be able to run some basic algorithms written with Z80-like assembly language.
